        <p><h1>Nuwa</h1> showed her empathy to people while seeing them be affected by the disaster, so she made up the sky with five colored stones, cut the foot of the god's turtle to support the four poles, flattened the flood, and removed the adverse qi through Yin and Yang, so that all souls could live in peace.

         <p>In Chinese mythology, Nuwa created people. She made dolls out of clay and gave them life.
